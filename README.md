# Ride-Sharing-System
This project creates a dynamic ride-sharing system that models a city’s transportation network using graph theory. Dijkstra’s algorithm is employed to calculate the shortest paths between locations, ensuring efficient travel routes. The system dynamically updates road conditions in real-time, adjusting to changing traffic patterns. Passengers are matched with the nearest available drivers, optimizing ride assignments and reducing wait times. This simulation serves as a foundation for more efficient urban transportation systems and real-time ride-sharing solutions.
